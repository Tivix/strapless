Dev setup
=========

### Node/Express version
From the home directory:
- ``npm install``
- ``node index.js``
- Visit localhost:3000 in your browser

On load, the page will use the static, compiled index.css file in ``public/static/css``. This file **must be compiled** with a `@base-color` defined.

On-the-fly scheme changes, either from the colorpicker form or by using a hex value in the url (e.g., `localhost:3000/CADFE6`), will use the index.less file in ``source/less``. This file **can not** contain a defined `@base-color` because the base color must be set at the time of compilation, based on user input.


Coding guidelines / standards
=============================

- Try to use semicolons between arguments in LESS mixins (unless it looks really bad)
- Only use classes where there's a mixin involved (classes should be generated by a mixin)
- Don't worry too much about CSS property order, but try to put the important stuff first
