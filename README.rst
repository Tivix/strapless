Dev setup
=========

From the home directory:

- ``python -m SimpleHTTPServer``
- Visit localhost:8000 in your browser

And you're done! Remember to use compiled CSS when you deploy to a production environment.


Coding guidelines / standards
=============================

- Try to use semicolons between arguments in LESS mixins (unless it looks really bad)
- Only use classes where there's a mixin involved (classes should be generated by a mixin)
- Don't worry too much about CSS property order, but try to put the important stuff first
